# MLB_Digital_Engagement1
A model that can predict daily MLB fan engagement given a wide range of variables t+1 day in advance. This project challenged me thru working with a large volume of data that needed to be organized and put into a dataframe. Joining the dataframes together for TTS required planning and knowing the specifics of the pd.merge, pd.concat, and pd.join methods. XGBoost was chosen first because of its iterative approach and minimization of the loss function. Domain knowledge was used to select the features that would help predict daily fan engagement. Out of the 50-60 features in the 6 csv's, I chose:


These features will drive MLB fan engagement because of:

excitement 
sport highlights
